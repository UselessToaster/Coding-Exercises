# Coding-Exercises
Just a place for me to post my daily exercises to keep my skills fresh
    
If there are ways to improve my code please let me know!
I know these are just simple applications,
and not the most useful in a practical sense,
but if i can apply a concept in a simple environment,
then i can do it in a more complex environment.

So any constructive criticism is greatly appreciated!
